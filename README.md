# Python_Desktop_Widget_Dual_Clock
Desktop Dual Clock Widget using Python
- **Practice Makes Perfect** : The best way to master programming is through consistent practice. Tinkering with code to achieve specific goals can be a highly effective learning method.
- **Widgets of the Past** : Windows once offered the convenience of desktop gadgets like clocks and CPU meters. These tools provided quick access to useful information right on the desktop.
- **A Tale of Two Timezones** : My project was to create a dual clock widget that not only tells my local time but also shows the time in my client's timezone.
- **Beyond Default Features** : While Windows allows adding multiple clocks, crafting one from scratch serves a dual purpose: utility and education.
- **Tkinter: The Pythonic Way** : The widget is built using Python's 'Tkinter' library, which is a standard GUI toolkit for Python.
- **Preparation is Key** : Ensure Python is installed on your system along with the 'pytz' module for timezone conversions.
- Install 'pytz' via pip with the command: `pip install pytz`.
- I am Using DS-DIGIT.TTF Font to display Date and Time to get the feel of Digital clock. Install It before running code. You can find the font file in repository.
- **Execution is Simple** : Save the script with a '.py' extension and run it. A window will pop up, displaying two clocks: one set to IST (Indian Standard Time) and the other to Central Time (Houston, Texas, USA).
- **Embrace the Code** : Dive into the world of coding with this hands-on project and enjoy the journey of learning and creating.

- Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
